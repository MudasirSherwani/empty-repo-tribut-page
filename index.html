                <h2>Michael <span class="style">Jackson</span></h2>
                <p>Michael Jackson began life in a working-class suburb of Gary, 
                Indiana. Naturally musical, he joined his brothers in a band 
                that would take the locals - and later the world - by storm
                29 August 1958, Michael Joseph 
                Jackson was born into a large, 
                working-class family in the small, 
                suburban town of Gary, Indiana, in the US. 
                Baby Michael was the seventh child 
                of Joseph and Katherine Jackson </p>
